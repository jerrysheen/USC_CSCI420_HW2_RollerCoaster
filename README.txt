USC ID 		: < 2080748504 >

Description: In this assignment, we use Catmull-Rom splines along with OpenGL core profile shader-based texture mapping and Phong shading to create a roller coaster simulation.

Core Credit Features: (Answer these Questions with Y/N; you can also insert comments as appropriate)
======================

1. Uses OpenGL core profile, version 3.2 or higher - 
Y
2. Completed all Levels:
  Level 1 : -Y
  level 2 : -Y   the ride is above the current position, look at my current tangent, 
	      but the up vector is (binormal, instead of normal. because I want to
	     make the initial ride horizontally.. you can check this from animation)
  Level 3 : -Y
  Level 4 : -Y
  Level 5 : -Y

3. Rendered the camera at a reasonable speed in a continuous path/orientation -
Y
4. Run at interactive frame rate (>15fps at 1280 x 720) -
Y
5. Understandably written, well commented code -
Y
6. Attached an Animation folder containing not more than 1000 screenshots -
Y
7. Attached this ReadMe File -
Y
Extra Credit Features: (Answer these Questions with Y/N; you can also insert comments as appropriate)
======================

1. Render a T-shaped rail cross section -
Y
2. Render a Double Rail -
Y
3. Made the track circular and closed it with C1 continuity -
Y
4. Any Additional Scene Elements? (list them here) -
Y ï¼š add rollercoaster support to make it more realistic
5. Render a sky-box -
Y
6. Create tracks that mimic real world roller coaster -
Y - behemoth roller coaster in canada's wonderland
7. Generate track from several sequences of splines -
Y
8. Draw splines using recursive subdivision -

9. Render environment in a better manner - 

10. Improved coaster normals -

11. Modify velocity with which the camera moves -

12. Derive the steps that lead to the physically realistic equation of updating u -
